## How data is collected
    - Interviews
    - Observations
    - Forms
    - Questionnaires
    - Surveys
    - Cookies

## Data collection considerations
    - How the data will be collected
    - Choose data sources
    - Decide what data to use
    - How much data to collect
    - Select the right data typ
    - Determine the time frame

## Population
All possible data values in a certain dataset

## Sample
A part of a population that is representative of the population

## Quantitative and quallitative data

## Discrete data
Data that is counted and has a limited number of values

## Continuous data
Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value

## Nominal data
A type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order

## Ordinal data
A type of qualitative data with a set order or scale

## Internal data
Data that lives within a company's own systems

## External data
Data that lives and is generated outside of an organization

## Structured data
Data organized in a certain format such as rows and columns

- Spreadsheet
- Relational Database

## Unstructured data
Data that is not organized in any easily identifiable manner

## Unstructured data examples
    - Audio Files
    - Video Files
    - Emails
    - Photos
    - Social media

## Data model
A model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another

## Data Elements
Pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers, and address

## Data type
A specific kind of data attribute that telss what kind of values the data is

## Data types in spreadsheets
    - Number
    - Text or string
    - Boolean

## Text or string data type
A sequence of characters and punctuation
that contains textual information

## Boolean data Type
A data type with only two posible values, such as TRUE or FALSE

## Rows -> Records
## Columns -> Fields

## Wide Data
Data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to 
hold the values of various attributes of the subject

## Long Data
Data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows

## Bias
A preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing

## Data bias
A type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction

## Sampling bias
A sample that isn't representative of the population as a whole

## More type of bias
    - Observer bias
    - Interpretation bias
    - Confirmation bias


## Observer bias (experimenter bias/ research bias)
The tendency for different people to observer things differently

## Interpretation bias
The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situation in a positive or negative way

## Confirmation bias
The tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs

# ROCCC

## Bad data sources don't ROCCC

## Every good solution is found by avoiding bad data


## Ethics
Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society fairness, or
specific virtues.

## Data Ethics
Well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is colleted,  shared, and used.

## GDPR
General Data Protected Regulation of the European Union

## Aspects of data ethics
    - Ownership
    - Transaction transparency
    - Consent
    - Currency
    - Privacy
    - Openness

## Ownership
Individual own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over
its usage, how it's processed, and how it's shared

## Transaction transparency
All data-processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable
and undertood by the individual who provides their data

## Consent
An individual's right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it

## Currency
Individuals should be aware of finacial transactions reulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions

## Privacy
Preserving a data subject's information and activity andy time a data transaction occurs

- Protection from anauthorized access to our private data
- Freedom from inappropriate use of our data
- The right to inspect, update, or correct our data
- Ability to give consent to use our data
- Legal right to access the data

## Openness
Free access, usage, and sharing of data

## Interoperability is key to open data's success

## Metadata
Data about data

## Databse
A collection of data stored in a computer system

## Relational database
A database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to form  relationships

## Primary Key
An identifier that references a colummn in which each value is unique

## Foreign key
A field within a table that is a primary key in another table

## Normalized database
A database in which only related data is stored in each table

## Redundancy
When the same piece of data is stored in two or more spearte places

## Schema
A way of describing how something is organized

- Metadata is used in database management to help data analysts interpret the contents of the data within the database

## 3 common types of metadata
    - Descriptive
    - Structural
    - Administrative

## Descriptive metadata
Metadata that describes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at later point in time

## Structural
Metadata that indicates how a piece of data is organized and whether it is part of one, or more thatn one, data collection

## Administractive
Metadata that indicate the technical source of a digital asset

## Metadata creates a single source of truth by keeping things consistend and uniform

## Metadata also makes data more reliadble by making sure it's accurate, precise, relevant, and timely

## Metadata repository
A databse specifically created to store metadata

## Metadata repositories make it easier and faster to bring together multiple soureces for data analysis

## Metadata repositories
    - Describe the state and location of the metadata
    - Describe the structures of the tables inside
    - Describe how the data flows through the repository
    - Keep track of who accesses the metadata and when

## Metadata is stored in a single, central location and gives the company standardized information about all of its data

## Data governance
A process to ensure the formal management of a company's assets

## Internal data
Data that lives within a company's own systems

## External data
Data that lives and is generated outside an organization

## CSV = Comma-separated values

## Sorting data
Arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to undertand, 
analyze, and visualize

## Filtering
Showing only the data tha meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest

## SQL
Structure Query Language

## Best practices when organizing data
    - Naming conventions
    - Foldering
    - Archiving older files

## Naming conventions
Consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file in its name

## Foldering

## Archiving older files

- Move Old projects to a separate location to create an archive and cut down on clutter

## Align your naming and storage practices with your team

## Develop metadata practices

- Think about how often you're making copies of data and storing it in different places

## File naming conventions
Consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file its name

# File naming DO's
    - Work out your conventions early
    - Align file naming with your team
    - Make sure file names are meaningful
    - keep file names short and sweet
    - Format dates yyymmdd: SalesReport20201125
    - Lead revision numbers with 0: SalesReport20201125v02
    - Use hyphens, undercores, or capitalized letters:
        - SalesReport_2020_11_25_v02
