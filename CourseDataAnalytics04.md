## Process

## A strong analysis depengds on the integrity of the data

## Data integrity
The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data 
throughtout its lifecycle

- Replicated
- Transferred
- Manipulated

## Data replication
The process of storing data in multiple locations

## Transferred
The process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another

## Manipulated

## Data manipulation
The process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read

## Other threats to data integrity
    - Human error
    - Viruses
    - Malware
    - Hacking
    - System failures

""" It's important to check that the data you use aligns with the business objective """

## What you can do when you have insufficient data.

## Types of insufficient data
    - Data from only source
    - Data that keeps updating
    - Outdated data
    - Geographically-limited data

## Ways to address insufficient data
    - Identify trends with the available data
    - Wait for more data if time allows
    - Talk with stakeholders and adjust you objective
    - Look for a new dataset

## Population
All possible data values in a certain dataset

## Sample size
A part of a population that is representative of the population

## Sampling bias
A sample isn't representative of the population as a whole

## Random sampling
A way of selecting a sample from a population so that every possible type of 
sample has an equal chance of being chosen

## Statistical Power
The probability of getting meaningful results from a test

## Hypothesis testing
A way to see if a survey or experiemnt has meaningful results

""" If a test is statiscally significant, it means the results of the test
are real and not an error caused by random chance """

""" Usually, you need a statistical power of at least zero point 8 or 80% to consider your results statistically significant """

## Confidence level
The probability that your sample size accurately reflects the greater population

## Having a 99% confidence level is ideal, but most industries hope for least a 90% or 95% percent confidence level

## Margin of error
The maximum amount that the sample result are expected to differ from those of the actual population

## To calculate margin of error you need:
    - Population size
    - Sample size
    - Confidence level

- Sample size = 500
- Population = 80,000,000
- Confidence level = 99%
- Margin of error = ?

#1 cause of poor quality data = human error

## Dirty data
Data that is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem you're trying to solve

## Concatenate
A fuction that joins multiple text strings into a single string

## Function

## COUNTIF

## Syntax
A predetermined structure that includes all required information and its proper placement

## =COUNTIF(range,"value")

## LEN
A function that tells you the length of a text string by counting the number of
characters it contains

## =LEN(range)

## LEFT
A function that gives you a set number of characters from the left side of a text string

## =LEFT(range, number of characters)

## RIGHT
A function that gives you a set number of characters from the right side of a text string

## =RIGHT(range, number of characters)

## =MID(range, reference starting point, number of middle characters)

## =CONCATENATE(item1, item2, 2)

## TRIM
A function that remove leading, trailing, and repeated spaces in data

## =TRIM(range)

## Pivot table
A data summarization tool that is used in data processing

## VLOOKUP = Vertical Lookup

## VLOOKUP 
A function that searches for a acrtain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information

## =VLOOKUP(data to look up,'where to look'!range, column, false)

## Data Mapping
The process of matching fields from one data source to another

""" SQL makes our lives easier when we're analyzing lots of different data """"

""" It's core skill and highly sought after by everybody """

## SQL

- SELECT
- FROM
- INSERT INTO
- VALUES
- UPDATE SET
- WHERE

of letters, numbers, or both

## Function SQL

## LENGTH = LEN

## SUBSTRING

## TRIM

## CAST(FIELDNAME AS DATATYPE)

## CANCAT
