"I think the visuals that come out of data analysis and data analytics
are really beautiful, but what is even more interesting for me are the 
stories behind them."

## Data visualization
    - The graphic representation and presentation of data

## Scientists and mathematicians began to truly embrace the idea of arranging
data visually in the 1700s and 1800s

    1. Looking at visuals in order to understand and draw conlcusions data
    2. Creating visuals using raw data to tell story

## Bar graphs
    - Use size contrast to compare two or more values

## Line graphs
    - Help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data

## Pie charst
    - Show how much each part of something makes up the whole

## Maps
    - Helps organize data geographically

"""
    On of your biggest considerations when creating a data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus
"""

## Histogram
    - A chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges

## Correlation charts
    - Show relationships among data

## Causation
    - Occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome

    1. Time series charts
    2. Histograms
    3. Ranked bar charts
    4. Correlation charts

## Static Visualizations
    - Do not change over time unless they're edited

## Dynamic Visualizations
    - Visualizations that are interactive or change over time

## Tableau
    - A business intelligence anda analytics platform that helps
    people see, understand, and make decisions with data

## The choice between using a static or dynamic visualization

## The elements of art
    - Line
    - Shape
    - Color
    - Space
    - Movement

## Hue
## Intensity
## Value

"""
Which one will make it easiest for the user to understand the 
point you're trying to make?
"""

## Data composition
    - Combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them
    together as a whole

## Elements for effective visuals
    - Clear meaning
    - Sophisticated use of contrast
    - Refined execution

## Design thiking
    - A process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way

## Five phases of the design process
    - Empathize
    - Define
    - Ideate
    - Prototype
    - Test

## Headline
    - A line of words printed in large letters at the top of the visualization
    to communicate what data is being presented

## Subtitle
    - Supports the headline by adding more context and description

## Legend
    - Identifies the meaning of various elemenets in a data visualization

## Ways to make data visualizations accessible:
    - Labeling
    - Text alternatives
    - Text-based format
    - Distinguishing
    - Simplify

## Alternative text
    - Alternative text provides a textual alternative to non-text content

"""
Accessibility is really about making sure that you are creating data visualiztions, graphs charts, tables that anyone can interact with, whether
they have a long-term or even a temporary form of impairment
"""

## Diverging color palette
    - Display two ranges of values using color intensity to intensity to show the magnitude of the number and the actual color to show which range the number is from

## Dashboard
    - A tool that organize information from multiple datasets into one central location for tracking analysis, and simple visualization

## Dashboard Filter
    - A tool for showing only the data meets a specific while hiding the rest

## Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them
a clear and convincing voice.
- Stephen Few

## Data storytelling
    - Communicating the meaning of a dataset with visuals and a narrative that
    are customized for each particular audience

## 3 data storytelling steps
    1. Engage your audience
    2. Create compelling visuals
    3. Tell the story in an interesting narratieve

## What role does this audience play?
## What is their stake in the project?
## What do they hope to get from the data insights I deliver?

## Spotlighting
    - Scanning throught data to quickly identify the most important insights
