    - A programming language frequently used for statiscal analysis, visualization, and other data analysis

    - Accessible
    - Data-centric
    - Open source
    - Community

## Open source
    - Code that is freely available and may be modified and shared by the people who use it

## R packages
    - Reproducing your analysis
    - Processing lots of data
    - Creating data visualizations

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    - A software application that brings together all the
    tools you may want to use in a single place
